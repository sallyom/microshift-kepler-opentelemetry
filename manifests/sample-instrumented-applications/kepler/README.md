## Kepler on MicroShift local VM to GrafanaCloud

This assumes MicroShift is running in a virtual machine.
SCP the configure script over to the VM.
Then, ssh into the virtual machine.

```bash
sudo virsh domifaddr microshift-starter # note the IP address 
export IP_ADDR=<ip address from above>
# password is 'redhat' for below cmds
scp ./configure-microshift-vm-kepler.sh  redhat@${IPADDR}:
ssh redhat@${IPADDR}
```

### Execute below commands from within the virtual machine

Configure cgroups-v2 and run the configuration script.

```bash
./configure-microshift-vm-kepler.sh ~/.pull-secret.json cgroupsv2=true
# script will ask for your RH account creds for subscription, then will run unattended
# reboot VM and ssh back in
```

#### Start MicroShift service

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now microshift
mkdir ~/.kube
sudo cp /var/lib/microshift/resources/kubeadmin/kubeconfig ~/.kube/config
sudo chown -R redhat:redhat ~/.kube
oc get pods -A # all pods should soon be running
```

#### Kepler Deployment

Kepler is a research project that that uses eBPF to probe CPU performance counters and Linux kernel tracepoints
to calculate an applicationâ€™s carbon footprint. Refer to [Kepler documentation](https://sustainable-computing.io/) for further information.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler.git
cd kepler
```

Edit the daemonset yaml at `manifests/config/exporter/exporter.yaml` like so.

```bash
        env:
        - name: NODE_NAME
          value: <VM IP_ADDRESS>
```

Uncomment the OpenShift lines in `manifests/config/exporter/kustomization.yaml`,
and remove the `[]` in the line `- patchesStrategicMerge: []`. Then, apply
the kepler manifests.

```bash
oc apply --kustomize $(pwd)/manifests/config/base
# Check that kepler pod is up and running before proceeding
```

#### Create OpenTelemetry Collector

(cd back to this repository)
Edit `manifests/otel-collector/02-otelcol-config.yaml` to configure the correct receivers, exporters, and pipelines.
If already running, add a prometheus receiver target for the kepler-exporter endpoint.

```bash
    receivers:
      prometheus:
        config:
          scrape_configs:
            - job_name: 'otel-collector'
              scrape_interval: 10s
              static_configs:
                - targets: ['<KEPLER-EXPORTER_ENDPOINT>:9102']
```

Then apply the configmap yaml files.
This example configures a `prometheusremotewrite` exporter to send data to GrafanaCloud.
View [this Grafana Engineering post](https://grafana.com/blog/2022/05/10/how-to-collect-prometheus-metrics-with-the-opentelemetry-collector-and-grafana/) for more details.


If OpenTelemetry collector is not already running

```bash
oc create ns otelcol
oc apply -n otelcol -k manifests/otel-collector/
```

An opentelemetry-collector pod should now be running in `-n otelcol`. View the logs of the kepler-exporter pod to
ensure kepler metrics are being exported from the kepler-exporter. View the logs of the opentelemetry collector pod
to ensure metrics are being collected from kepler-exporter.

### Import and view grafana dashboard

Follow the Grafana documentation to import the Kepler-Exporter dashboard.
